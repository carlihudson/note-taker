  ## Description
   This week's assignment was to add back-end functionality to pre-existing front-end starter code, so that users can add, save, and retrieve notes and reminders. It's a simple application that makes it easy for users to keep track of notes of important information that is easily accessible. This project was done entirely with javascript, and used the express, path, fs, and short-unique-id modules.
